# 🐩 Poodle's Code Lab

**Woof woof!** Welcome to **Poodle's Code Lab**, where I, the coding poodle, am here to help my master **Ivan Kovtun** write code while occasionally chasing my own tail! 🐾

## About Me

Hey hoomans! I’m  **Gross the Poodle**, the fluffiest coding sidekick you’ll ever meet! I take my coding duties very seriously... sort of. When I’m not barking out code suggestions, you can catch me sniffing around the keyboard or pawing at the keys when I get excited. And let's not forget my professional snack-fetching skills! 🍖
